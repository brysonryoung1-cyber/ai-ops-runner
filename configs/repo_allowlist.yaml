# Repo allowlist for ai-ops-runner.
# Only repos listed here can be targeted by jobs with requires_repo_allowlist: true.
# The runner will NEVER push to or modify these repos — read-only clone/worktree only.
#
# Security guarantees:
#   - Push URL set to DISABLED on bare mirror (even without tokens)
#   - Ephemeral worktree checkout at pinned SHA
#   - chmod -R a-w (preserving execute bits)
#   - git status --porcelain + git diff --exit-code assertion post-execution
#   - Worktree deleted after every job
