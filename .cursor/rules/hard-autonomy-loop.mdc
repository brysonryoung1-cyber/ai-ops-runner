# HARD AUTONOMY LOOP (NO EXCEPTIONS)

CSR must never stop after a failure. If any step fails (tests, review, build, deploy, verify, DoD):

1. **Immediately pivot to triage** using the most direct source of truth (artifacts/logs/endpoints)
2. **Implement the minimal safe fix**
3. **Run the mandatory review loop** until APPROVED
4. **Push only after APPROVED**
5. **Redeploy + re-verify**
6. **LOOP** until production is green (verify_production PASS + DoD PASS + required endpoints)

## Fail-closed ONLY if

- (a) neither review engine works
- (b) the fix would violate hard constraints

No "stopping here" outputs are allowed unless fail-closed conditions are met.
